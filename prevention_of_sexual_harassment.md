# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## Q1. What actions are considered sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes any **unwanted behaviour** that makes a person feel uncomfortable, threatened, or demeaned. Examples are:

- **Physical conduct**: unwanted touching, patting, grabbing, or obstructing someone’s movement.  
- **Spoken remarks**: comments about appearance, suggestive jokes, sexually charged remarks, or persistent advances.  
- **Non-verbal cues**: leering, suggestive hand movements, or showing inappropriate images or videos.  
- **Digital harassment**: sending offensive messages, inappropriate images, emails, or continuously messaging without consent.  
- **Abuse of authority**: requesting personal favours in exchange for promotions, or threatening job security.

## Q2. What should you do if you experience or observe harassment?

If you face or see harassment:

- **Speak up when safe** – Politely but firmly let the person know the behaviour is unacceptable.  
- **Document everything** – Note the date, time, location, and persons involved in the incident.  
- **Report it** – Inform the Internal Committee (IC), HR, or the designated PoSH officer immediately.  
- **Support others** – If you witness harassment, stand by the affected person and encourage them to report.  
- **Take all incidents seriously** – Do not ignore repeated minor incidents; they deserve to be addressed.

## Q3. How scenario-based videos help in understanding harassment

- Videos show real-world workplace examples (like inappropriate comments, gestures, or touching) to illustrate what constitutes harassment.  
- They help distinguish acceptable behaviour from unacceptable actions.  
- They show appropriate responses — such as clearly saying “No,” reporting to HR or the IC, and supporting colleagues.

- Do not remain silent — escalate the matter to HR, the Internal Committee, or your manager.  
- Keep a written account of the event (when, where, who was involved).  
- Provide support to others who are experiencing similar harassment.
