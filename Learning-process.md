## Question 2  
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

- I can give 100% attention while working. If i get distracted i can take a run or boost my brain cell. so, that i can grasp and concentrate well, track my time with tools, and focus on understanding concepts deeply instead of rushing through.   
- I will not use my phone while I'm learning, Once I learnt with a concept I can stand in front of mirror and explain it to me or explain it to my friends.
- Actually, I have already implemented those teaching method in my life when i was preparing for my board exams and it helped me well.
